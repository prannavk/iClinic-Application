iClinic - Clinic and Appointments Management System Project

## Author:
**Krishna Pranav Kuchimanchi**

## Scope and Project Context:
- This is a Web Application which mainly helps users in scheduling and managing their appointments digitally with a Doctor and have a one one one digital communication channel with the Doctor. Since this Project's use-case fits the real life example of organizing the communication between a patient and a Doctor as we see in Hospitals and Clinics, I have built this project around that example. This application may also fit the definition of a general purpose appointment booking and management system.

## Basic Application Deliverables
- Create, Schedule and Delete Appointments based on Calendar (Virtual or Physical Usescase options inlcuded)
- 1 to 1 Communication channel with the Doctor or Person of Interest.
- Upload Files or Data into Account Profile accessible to the Doctor or Person of Interest.
- Access and Indulge in Information and services of the Doctor or Person of Interest.
